These are my findings about the various variants turned in by my team mates.

I've had a look at:
Michael
Dennis
Thomas
Ewoud

Assignment 1:
Not really sure which is best. I like the comments leading back to the math problem in Ewoud's solution.
Although I like the naming in the others more.

Assignment 2:
I like Ewoud's solution best and I think my elaborate answer explaining the open questions is best.

Assignment 3:
I think Ewoud's solution is best together with my elaborate answer. Also naming of the factorial function to
"factorial" might be more clear.

Assignment 4:
Thomas his solution is best I think. I agree with Ewoud's comment about not using quick check
and I think my answer is the solution to "test" this.

Assignment 5:
I like my solution best in terms of readability and conciseness. I think we should add Dennis his comment about
testing the solution and also include the real "answers" of the range and result.

Assignment 6:
I think mine is most concise but I'm not really sure which I like most.

Assignment 7:
Thomas his solution would be best here I believe. It's the easies on the eyes ;). We should however include
my comments + test cases.

Assignment 8:
Ewoud's solution + some of my additional comments for clarity
