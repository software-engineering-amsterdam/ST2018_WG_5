These are my findings about the various variants turned in by my team mates.

I've had a look at:
Michael
Dennis
Thomas
Ewoud

Assignment 1:
I prefer Ewoud's solution, but it might be better to separate the chi test from the actual
assignment. So that it doesn't cloud the original assignment which doesn't include the chi test.

I think also it's good to write a bit about why using the chi test vs just running it a few times and
guessing that it's random.

Assignment 2:
I prefer my solution + documentation, since it's most concise + most elaborate on the logic used.

Assignment 3:
I prefer the solution of Thomas and also his docs is fine. Everything is elaborate + organised nicely.

Assignment 4:
Not really sure here. QuickCheck is nice to include, although mine was very slow since big lists are being created.
So maybe Ewoud's solution?

Assignment 5:
Ewoud's solution looks best, and is also using quickcheck.

Assignment 6:
I like mine best, since it works with any characters (they are just not being encoded)

Assignment 7:
I like mine best, although the GL... test case from Thomas should be included as well
