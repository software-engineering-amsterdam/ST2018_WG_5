VOTES (not voting for myself):
1: Michael
2: Michael
3: Thomas
4: Michael/Thomas

DISCUSSION:

1:
I think that they want us to use the logic as building blocks.
So you have to rewrite definitions using other definitions.
Fits the logic + haskell way of thinking (??? ASSUME).


2:
Motivation: rest has nothing :').
I believe the actual generator from michael belongs to assignment 4 but
we can (should?) use his approach to test the parser.

3:
Regarding michaels confusement.
I believe we had to do something similar to arrowfree and nnf in the source of Lecture3.hs 
AKA implement the cnf (step 3) to complement arrowfree (step 1) and nnf (step 2).

4:
I believe using the arbitrary (instance Arbitrary Form where) is the correct
approach but i have no source for that.
I do like the extensive tests Thomas has.
Perhaps combine or use go for thomas.

NOTES regarding my own work:

I think what i have done for assignment 3 and 4 is correct
but I have a hard time actually veryfing it.
Quickcheck seems happy but I only manually checked/verified with shorter
input on paper.
