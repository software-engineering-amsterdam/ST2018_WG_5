Assignment 1: Ewoud
Note: Seems to be correct and a smart way of solving the last 2. Also good tests!

Assignment 2: ? we should choose the best generator
Note: I seem the be the only one that came up with some working quickCheck solution.
Only issue is that it tends to go deeeeep and generate a very big almost endless nested formula.

Assignment 3: Michael
Did I miss the point here? It looks quite simple and it works hmmm. So maybe mine is not correct
in which I'd choose Thomas or Ewoud.

Assignment 4: ? we should choose the best generator
Same story as 2

Side note: I'm note sure which generator method is best :/
